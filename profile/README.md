## üöÄ Overview

**Data Eraser Pro** is a professional macOS utility for permanently erasing files, folders, partitions, or entire disks. Unlike standard "Move to Trash" operations, which leave recoverable traces, this software uses advanced **data overwrite algorithms** to make deleted data completely unrecoverable.  

Whether you‚Äôre selling your Mac, retiring an old drive, or working with sensitive corporate information, Data Eraser Pro guarantees peace of mind by wiping disks securely. It offers multiple erasure standards, from simple one-pass overwrites to government-grade methods like **DoD 5220.22-M** or **Gutmann (35-pass)**, ensuring data is destroyed beyond the reach of recovery tools.  

The app features an intuitive interface with drag-and-drop simplicity for files and folders, plus advanced options for full disk erasure and partition management. It supports **HDDs, SSDs, USB drives, SD cards, external hard drives, and even RAID volumes**.  

Lightweight yet powerful, Data Eraser Pro is trusted by IT professionals, businesses, and individuals who demand maximum security for their data. By combining usability with industrial-strength data wiping, it ensures your privacy stays protected.
